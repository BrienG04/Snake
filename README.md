This game is a simple revamp of the famous snake game only with some extras. In this version, you are able to utilize power ups which can give you different effects. Blue gives you temporary speed, Pink shrinks you by 2, Yellow doubles the snake size for a couple of seconds, and Cyan gives you triple per pellet eaten.
This assignment was completed for my COP2800 class at Miami Dade College.
